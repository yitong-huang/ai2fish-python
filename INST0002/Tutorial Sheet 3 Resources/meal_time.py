"""
A real world program to present meal specials to customers from a restaurant and with a note for each meal. If the meal enter is not on the list
then the program will print an error message. The program should continously request the customers for input.

Getting input and formatting output is often very important to use scripts to write such a program. The restaurant decides to write the program to ask the customer to 
enter the meal time that they are interested in. Write your if-statement to print out only the meal time selected by the customer.
