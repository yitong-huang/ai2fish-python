  # define your conditional statements here.

  # Check whether the input entered is valid, between 1 and 20



    # Define a condition to check whether the guess is low

# Check using an if conditional statement whether the guess is the correct guess and the number of guess is 1!



# Check if the condition is met and the player guess is correct
# Display the WINNER -- game statement


# Otherwise, display the LOST -- game statement
